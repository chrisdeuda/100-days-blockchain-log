# 100DaysOfBlockchain
I have taken the challenge to consistently learn and code with the blockchain development

I'll be tweeting my progress with #100DaysOfBlockchain | #100DaysOfCode hashtag on my twitter account [Chr1sHustler](https://twitter.com/Chr1sHustler).

## Main Goals
---

To transition from Fullstack Web Developer into Blockchain Engineer.


## Start Date
---
October 24th, 2018.

### Additional Rules
---

1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode | #100DaysOfBlockchain
2. If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
3. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
4. I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
5. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge.
