## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode | #100DaysOfBlockchain

### R1Day 1: October 25. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 
- Spent time writing test code for Kickstarter campaign Solidity Contract in Udemy Solidity Course. 
- Setup as well deployment code in Rinkeby

**Thoughts:**

- I've already start learning blockchain development amount ago and I've gone through a lot of some course online but I didn't be able to track my progress 'cause I just discover #100DaysOfCode this week.
- It seems writing Smart Contract requires a lot of writing test case which most of programmers hate to do. It's understandable since we are dealing with money and immutable data in the blockchain.
- Setting up deployment of Smart Contracts requires some configurations and setup which I still familiarizing myself. It's kinda like you are deploying your web application in the live site. I wish there are some sort of framework that handles this setting and all you have to do is supply some strings to make it work.

## R1D2,  October 27, Saturday

**Today's Progress:** 
- Created front-end for campaigns list of Solidity Smart Contract — Continuation of Ethereum Solidity Course.

**Thoughts:**

- I didn't be able to continue the course last night 'cause I was on the meetup with my friend in Makati for some good time.
- It's nice to use a lot of react props and states. It was much easier to handle the processing and displaying of data from the smart contract.
- I've used the semantic-ui-react ( recommendation on the course ) as a away to easily create components and ui for front-end development in react-js.
- I've came from the background of mostly using jquery for data bindings and displaying of data. React JS seems remove all of those long codes just to updates the states of the view.
- The course that I'm currently taking mostly focus now on the processing the Ethereum Solidity contract in the front-end. As my friend in blockchain development mentions that it seems tha blockchain part is just 10% only of the actual development .

## R1D3,  October 28, Sunday

**Today's Progress:**
- Create forms for submitting new campaigns with error handler using try catch when Metamask emits and error.
- Plus added loading icon when user submit the form.  — Continuation of Ethereum Solidity Course

**Thoughts:**

- Create forms for submitting new campaigns with error handler using try catch when Metamask emits an error
- Since blockchain transactions doesn't happen instantaneously it's important to have a loading icon so that the user will now the there is something being process on the background.

## R1D4,  October 29, Monday

**Today's Progress:**
- Implements navigation in the campaign.
- Plus debug some compatibility issues of Metamask new versions.  — Continuation of Ethereum Solidity Course

**Thoughts:**

- It seems that the React Next.JS requires additional modules in order to run a complex routing. Just like in the PHP Laravel.
- **Debugging Metamask Compatibility Issues**
    - Got stuck in sending transaction in Rinkeby network from the front-end. After sending transactions the fallback function is not  being trigger. Although the transactions are being sent to the network.
    - After digging on some issues on why this happening. I found out that the latest version of the Metamask 4.12 upgrade 'cause an error. Their suggestion is to downgrade to Metamask version 4.9 or 4.11 . They already have some patch for the updates Metamask 4.13 and 4.13. Refferrence to issues  [udemy solidity course](https://www.udemy.com/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide/learn/v4/questions/5286096), [github issue](https://www.udemy.com/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide/learn/v4/questions/5293220) and [github issue](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/issues/5425).
    - **Temporary Solution:** *Since I'm lazy to setup the lower versions. I remember I still have metamask lower version in my Brave browser. I didn't update it yet so I will be using my Brave browser for now to the testing of the version.*

## R1D5,  October 30, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** 
 - Redeploy Smart Contract in Rinkeby Network 'cause of additional functionalities in the Campaign Contract.
 - Plus integrate get summaries of campaign to front-end  — Continuation of Ethereum Solidity Course.

**Thoughts:**
 - When calling multiple data in the blockchain, it is best to create another functions that process the getting the data so that we don't need to create multiple request. Imagine if you need to pull atleast 5-10. It would take a while to be able to process the data.

 - When Redeploying contracts in the blockchain it creates new instance /address so basically the old data that have been created is no longer usable. I think there must be a way to be able to migrate the old data to the new instance of the contract ( I didn't be able to explore it yet on how to do it).
 - I've check as well some applications that have been built on last ETH Hackathon in San Franciso. There are a lot of useful applications that have been developer. You can check it [here](https://ethsanfrancisco.devpost.com/submissions?page=1).

## R1D6,  October 31, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** 
 - Integrate Campaing New Request contract to front-end UI using React JS- Continuation of Ethereum Solidity Course. https://goo.gl/5cvPNn
 - Read great article in What are the things that need to be learned to become blockchain developer. https://goo.gl/iqePJv

**Thoughts:**
 - The current forms is almost the same with the previous form which it will create new campaigngs contract in the front-end.
 - It seems there are lot of technology that needs to be learned in order to become blockchchain developer ( Just one step at a time). Great Article from Constantin Kostenko . https://goo.gl/iqePJv
 - I've check as well some other good courses online for possible certifications for blockchain engineer (I think it might be handy soon 'cause blockchain developer is highly specialized field)

## R1D7,  November 01, Thursday

**Today's Progress:** 
 - Finished the last forms integration of the smart contract in front-end
 - Completed the Ethereum and Solidity: The Complete Developer's Guide ( Yes).

**Thoughts:**
 - I've got stuck in the testing of the transactions in the network because it takes time to validate the transactions in the Rinkeby Network ( Like 40 mins waiting to finish the transactions). It makes me wonder if there are other networks that could easily validate if the transactions and code work as expected.
 - I've checked on other stackoverflow, other people got stuck as well like 24 hours just to verify if their transactions are verified. This will really slow down the development if there is no other way to be able to validate quickly the transactions.
- Some of the errors in Front-end here while waiting for the transactions
    - [Error: Transaction was not mined within750 seconds, please make sure your transaction was properly sent. Be aware that it might still be mined!  ](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/issues/1763).
    - [Rinkeby is extremely slow at confirming transactions](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/39191/rinkeby-is-extremely-slow-at-confirming-transactions).
- I think I was really to start to get comfortable in developing Smart Contract in Ethereum. Probably Need to develop more dApps in the solidity.

## R1D8,  November 02, Friday
**Today's Progress:** 
 - Check alternative development tools in Solidity Development.
 - Explore setting up Ethereum private blockchain in local using Geth with Mist Browser.
 
**Thoughts:**
 - Interacting with the Geth command line seems cool.
 - The local node will speed up the development process since when I'm using the testnet. Before, it requires at least 15-30 seconds waiting time.
 - I'm thinking of setting up as well an ethereum node but I've read that it requires a lot of storage and it consumes some computing power.

## R1D9,  November 03, Saturday

**Today's Progress:**

- Check the registration for on the blockchain Hackahton.
- Brainstorm for dApps Idea in Blockchain Hackathon in the Philippines.
- Explore WhitePaper of Ethereum for use cases in dApps Development.

**Thoughts:**

- Last week I'm thinking of Joining the Hackathon for Blockchain development but I don't have yet idea on what to develop. And today, I've got some idea for potentials dApps that I will be going to develop. I don't have a team but I've already joined in the slack group to hunt for a possible team.
- I know It's only been a month since I start diving into the technicalities of blockchain development. The other part of me got a little bit scared to join in the Hackathon since I only have few months of experience ( mainly on the smart contract development and integrations to the front-end ) using React JS. I'm just wearing the mask "Fake it until you make it".
- I didn't yet register on the Hackathon 'cause I don't have team ( though there is an option their if you will be joining as a individual ). Hey, it's more fun if I will join with team. haha.

## R1D10,  November 04, Sunday

**Today's Progress:**

- Star challenge on Crypto Zombies : Beginner to Intermediate Smart Contract.
- Write Draft for my next blog post on "My First Month in Learning Blockchain Development".
  

**Thoughts:**

- It was nice to play around with Smart Contract by Creating Crypto Zombies. The smart contract requires some basic knowledge on the OOP.
- I've finished the Level 1 and level 2 challenge.
- **On writing my next blog** - It's been more than a month since I start learning the blockchain development. It feels like eternity when I try to breakdown the progress that I've made in my blog post. I try a lot of tutorials and just exploring things on the go. There still a lot to learn to become a Blockchain Engineer. I will publised it tomorrow since still need to refine some grammars and add more images.

## R1D11,  November 05, Monday

**Today's Progress:**

- I've written my new  blog content on "My First Month on Learning Blockchain Development".
- Finished Level 3 of Crypto Zombie.

**Thoughts:**

- It's really nice to track your progress no matter how small it is. Yeah, It's been a month since I'm studying the blockchain development. I know that there are still a lot to learn but it was nice to track where you are now and prepare for another round.
- It seems it was a little bit hard to the advance level of the cryto zombie. There are others complicated concepts in OOP.

## R1D12,  November 06, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:**

- Finished the level 4 and 5 of the CryptoZombie Lesson in Solidity.
- Learned about the ERC721 Standards.
- Implements SimpleMath Library.


**Thoughts:**

- Learned about how to make your functions secure.
- Learned that there is no simple way to generate a random number in solidity. You need to use some functions in order to achieve it. Plus it is not yet secure and could be easy to exploit.
- Tokens, the ERC721 standard, and tradable assets/zombies
- Libraries and how to use them.
- How to prevent overflows and underflows using the SafeMath library.
- Commenting your code and the natspec standard.

## R1D13,  November 07, Wednesday

**Today's Progress:**

- Finished Level 6 of Cryptozombies. Mainly integrations of the contract to front-end.


**Thoughts:**

- Since on my first course on Udemy on Solidity. It uses the React JS and now on the CrytoZombie, it uses the jQuery. I start to see now, the main difference of the React JS with the old jQuery in terms of handling and binding the data to HTML. - There is less code when using the React JS
- Not all of the features have been implemented in the front-end integration and they let the user decide to implement it on there. Which kinda cool since you will be a real challenge to implement the other features.

# R1D14  November 08, Thursday

- Attended pre hackathon meetups DISH ( Decentralized Innovations Startup Hackathon).
- Didn't be able to code much today since I've got problem with my Macbook Pro Charger.

**Thoughts:**
- This is my first time to attend dev meetups in Craft Beer. There is a lot of beer in the space and it feels like not all of the people in the meetup are not devs. 
- Didn't be able to code much today since I've got problem with my Macbook Pro Charger

# R1D15  November 13, Tuesday

- Complete the Basic Todo App tutorial( Article) on Vue JS. 

**Thoughts:**
- The guide is somewhat good since there are missing pieces in the codes that you need to debug on your own. It kinda helps me to really familiarize and not just mindlessly following the tutorial. And by this time I actually just dive with the project since I've already use VueJS before. Just need some refresher.
- It's been 4 days since I put logs on the challenge. Got a little bit busy handling new remote work referred to me by my friend. I will still try to continue the study of the blockchain development at least 1-2 hours a day.
- I think I should really focus on actually creating simple projects that I create and conceptualized from the scratch since it provides more challenge. Enough of Udemy course and Video Tutorials. Watching tutorials doesn't really retain the information in my head and it's kinda boring. 
- I like to do more tinkering and exploring with the technology.
