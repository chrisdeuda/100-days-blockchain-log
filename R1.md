## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode | #100DaysOfBlockchain

### R1Day 1: October 25. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Spent time writing test code for Kickstarter campaign Solidity Contract in Udemy Solidity Course. Setup as well deplyoment code in Rinkeby


**Thoughts:** 
* I've already start learning blockchain development amount ago and I've gone through a lot of some course online but I didn't be able to track my progress 'cause I just discover #100DaysOfCode this week. 
* It seems writing Smart Contract requires a lot of writing test case which most of programmers hate to do. It's understandable since we are dealing with money and immutable data in the blockchain. 
* Setting up deployment of Smart Contracts requires some configurations and setup which I still familiarizing myself. It's kinda like you are deploying your web application in the live site. I wish there are some sort of framework that handles this setting and all you have to do is supply some strings to make work.
