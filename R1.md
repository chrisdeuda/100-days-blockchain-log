## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode | #100DaysOfBlockchain

### R1Day 1: October 25. Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Spent time writing test code for Kickstarter campaign Solidity Contract in Udemy Solidity Course. Setup as well deployment code in Rinkeby

**Thoughts:**

- I've already start learning blockchain development amount ago and I've gone through a lot of some course online but I didn't be able to track my progress 'cause I just discover #100DaysOfCode this week.
- It seems writing Smart Contract requires a lot of writing test case which most of programmers hate to do. It's understandable since we are dealing with money and immutable data in the blockchain.
- Setting up deployment of Smart Contracts requires some configurations and setup which I still familiarizing myself. It's kinda like you are deploying your web application in the live site. I wish there are some sort of framework that handles this setting and all you have to do is supply some strings to make it work.

## R1D2,  October 27, Saturday

**Today's Progress:** Created front-end for campaigns list of Solidity Smart Contract — Continuation of Ethereum Solidity Course.

**Thoughts:**

- I didn't be able to continue the course last night 'cause I was on the meetup with my friend in Makati for some good time.
- It's nice to use a lot of react props and states. It was much easier to handle the processing and displaying of data from the smart contract.
- I've used the semantic-ui-react ( recommendation on the course ) as a away to easily create components and ui for front-end development in react-js.
- I've came from the background of mostly using jquery for data bindings and displaying of data. React JS seems remove all of those long codes just to updates the states of the view.
- The course that I'm currently taking mostly focus now on the processing the Ethereum Solidity contract in the front-end. As my friend in blockchain development mentions that it seems tha blockchain part is just 10% only of the actual development .
